## VIRTUAL_ECOSYSTEM

A midterm project for **OOP** course. It represents most functionalities we've learnt during second **semester in 2024**. Reviewed by professor as fulfilling criteria for low-advanced OOP. 

## GOAL_OF_PROJECT

Creating a simple ***Life-like application***, based on **objects**, **file-reading** and **saving stages** to a text file.

## PRINCIPLES

The game starts with pre-defined map, which is editable by player. Every organism (*bacteria, fungi, algae*) is replicating to take as much space as it's possible. All of them has unique set of actions, determining whether they destroy other objects or when they die. The simulation ends after 200 stages (pre-set in code) or when all organisms are **dead**. Every stage is being saved to a file, which helps to monitor current status of environment.
